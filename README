Savepoints
==========

************************
clone of the SVN repository of Jonathan Viney (http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/rails/plugins/savepoints/)
Added support for Oracle 
[spint]
************************


This plugin adds support for savepoints to ActiveRecord.

The original behaviour whereby nested calls to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do not result in the opening of
new transactions or savepoints has been maintained.To require a savepoint pass :force => true to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction.

  # No savepoints opened, original Rails behaviour
  Person.transaction do
    Person.transaction do
    end
  end
  
  # Savepoint opened by inner transaction
  Person.transaction do
    Person.transaction :force => true do
    end
  end
  
Issues surrounding the use of transactional fixtures in tests have also been addressed by ensuring that the first call to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction
inside a test case always opens a new savepoint even without passing :force => true.

  class MyTestCase < Test::Unit::TestCase
    self.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    
    def my_test
      # Savepoint opened for outer call to transaction
      Person.transaction do
      end
    end
  end

This plugin is based on patches submitted by tarmo at http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/5457
